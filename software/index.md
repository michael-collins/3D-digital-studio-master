## A Note About Hardware

If you currently use MacOSX, many software packages will be available to you with varying levels of stability. Blender runs extremely well on MacOSX. Windows based computers and NVidia Graphics cards have considerably more wide-spread software and peripheral support. Additionally, Windows computers tend to cost less for higher spec'd machines. Apple eliminated advanced driver support for NVidia graphics cards in there newer oeprating systems and is moving away from Intel processors, therefore the future of Apple support for CGI software is not known.

## What software should I use?

If you don't know what software to use, and are not comfortable deviating from the course learning modules, you should use the latest version of Blender. If you would like an explaination of why, or would prefer to use another software, keep reading.

## Software and the CGI Industry

This is a digital art class within an accredited art school. We will use industry tools and craft within an academic context. This can be confusing, but it explained in more detail in the course learning materials.

Beginning to learn 3D with Blender will be the easiest option for a variety of reasons. Blender provides enough functionality for an entire 3D animated film production pipeline within one package. It also has support for 2D animation workflows, 3D printing, and others, but film production is the most complex pipeline. Most 3D software packages operate with the same principles and use the same algorithms invented by early industry pioneers as well as and recent technological innovations. Many support scripting langauges, typically Python, and may simultaneously include their own proprietary scripting language. However, some workflows that exist in some packages do not exist in others, and 3D artists may use multiple software depending on their goals.

If you learn the fundamental principles of how 3D software works, chances are you can learn how to use and understand any other 3D software package. Not all software teaches you the fundamentals as you use the software. For instance, Maxon Cinema4D is a popular choice for motion graphics artists because of it's intutive interface, but it obscures most of how 3D works under the hood. If you only plan to use C4D forever, this doesn't really matter. However, you would have a tougher time switching to another package like Maya or Blender from C4D, than switching to C4D from those packages.

To gain a deep knowledge of one particular software package, it may take your entire career, and even then you won't know how to do everything. For this reason, the industry breaks job roles into specializations for aspects of a production pipeline. For instance you may become an expert on lighting and color theory, and know the ins and outs of 3D lighting tools. If you want to be a digital sculptor and texture painter, you will need to have a mastery of human anatomy, animal anatonmy, and color theory to invent believable fictious creatures. The time spent mastering that specialization won't afford you time to learn other aspects of the field. You can learn how to do everything to some extent, but it's not realistic that you would be able to be master every aspect of production. When you look at film credits for a CG-heavy movie, you will see all VFX studios and people involved, along with their specialties.

Some companies want to hire people with a high level of knowlege in a particular software and skill within that software. Some are looking for someone who has general knowledge and can use different software as needed. Some want to hire you to use their propritary software that they developed in-house (DreamWorks, Pixar), and will train you once you are hired. There is no one "inudstry standard" software tool despite many people claiming there are. It can be helpful to have deep knowledge of one software package, and to have some familiarity with others demonstrated through portfolio projects. The amount of free training that now exists on the Internet makes it possible for you to learn on demand, which may be what you have to do to get your foot in the door. In order to be able to learn on demand, an understanding and mastery of the common fundamentals is needed.

## What should I focus on?

If you don't know what direction to go in, try to get a general feel for everything, and be conscious of the art and design theory that supports each specialization. If you are attempting to match the requirements of an industry job description, some research will be in order. I recommend also looking at Internship requirements as well as fulltime job requirements, since you'll have an easier time obtaining an internship first. Each VFX studio, animation studio, game studio, or other creative production studio will use a different set of software tools. Since no single course, or even an entire curriculum, can possibly train students on every production workflow and their respective software packages, you will be asked to demonstrate knowledge of the fundamentals through whatever tool you use, and will only be explicitly taught the fundamentals through Blender in this course.

## 3D Design for Manufacutring

This course caters more to image making, whether moving or not, to convey story or meaning. Product design and architecture can also be used to convey meaning, though this tends to be from speculative design approaches. In the field of architecture and product or industrial design, Coputer Aided Design (CAD) software is used to create 2D and 3D models that can generate blueprints for buildings, supply manufacturing specialists with tool paths, can be analyzed for design optimizations, or can create visualizations for explaining design features, packaging, and marketing needs. CAD software used to have poor support for creating realistic rendered images, and it would have to be exported to other software to accomplish this. Now they typically come with advanced rendering engines and material presets built-in to skip this step. CAD is the most precise way to design an object for manufacturing, but you could never use CAD software to model and texture a believable human or animal with current software. You could design the Iron Man suit in CAD to build the physical prop, but to use in film, you would also import and alter or rebuild the 3D model for use in animation packages. If you want to learn 3D for object making, Rhino3D, options from AutoDesk, and Dassault Syst√®mes are the leading options.
