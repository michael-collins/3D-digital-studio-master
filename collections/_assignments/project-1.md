## Overview

**Project theme:** Primitives

Primitives are simple starting points. These are objects that act as elements with which you can arrange into more complex designs, or upon which details and complexity can be embedded. Primitives typically begin without context or meaning. Only through the manipulation, recombination, subtraction, and transformation of primitive elements is meaning and context constructed, either through the performance of these actions or within the end result of these actions. If we consider the idea that a primitive does not need to physically exist (existing but without a body), then primitives can act as conceptual building blocks, with which larger ideas can be constructed.

For this project, I would like you to imagine physical or conceptual building blocks.  Define, describe, and  your ideas in a poster format.

### Approaches

1. **Deconstruction approach:** Consider an object, system, or other thing that you are interested in.
   * Conceptually or physically identify the subject's core primitives. identify how these primitives are combined to create the end result.
   * How might these primitives be recombined in new ways, or how might the primitives be presented to viewers to help them change their understanding of your subject?
   * How will you visually present your ideas?
2. **Formal approach:** Identify some objects that you are interested in. These could be characters, environments, vehicles, products, architecture, aspects of the environment or ecosystem, etc.
   *  What shapes, patterns, structures, materials, etc., are they made from?
   * What context or setting are these objects typically found?
   * Explore how you could recombine these elements in unexpected ways.
3. **Social systems approach:** Consider the larger picture of a particular social or cultural 'system' in which you are interested. For example, you might be interested in the justice system, the economy, housing, etc.
