## Overview

**Project theme:** Primitives

Primitives are simple starting points. These are objects that act as elements with which you can arrange into more complex designs, or upon which details and complexity can be embedded. Primitives typically begin without context or meaning. Only through the manipulation, recombination, subtraction, and transformation of primitive elements is meaning and context constructed, either through the performance of these actions or within the end result of these actions. If we consider the idea that a primitive does not need to physically exist (existing but without a body), then primitives can act as conceptual building blocks, with which larger ideas can be constructed.

For this project, I would like you to imagine physical or conceptual building blocks.

### Approaches (Choose one)

1. **Bounding approach:** Consider an object, system, or other thing that you are interested in.
   * Conceptually or physically identify the subject's core primitives. identify how these primitives are combined to create the end result.
   * How might these primitives be recombined in new ways, or how might the primitives be presented to viewers to help them change their understanding of your subject?
   * What can be edited out or subtracted?
2. **Revealing approach:** Identify objects that captivate your imagination. These could be characters, environments, vehicles, shapes, materials, products, architecture, aspects of the environment or ecosystem, etc.
   *  What shapes, patterns, structures, materials, etc., are they made from?
   * What context or setting are these objects typically found?
   * Explore how you could recombine or juxtapose elements in unexpected ways to create something new or establish a new context.
   * Consider using a process like photography, audio recording, sketching, scanning, 3D scanning or photogrammetry to incorporate analog process or elements.
3. **Intervening approach:** Consider the larger picture of a particular social or cultural 'system' in which you are interested. For example, you might be interested in the justice system, the economy, etc.
   * What are the components that comprise these systems? How are these systems established? Who or what are the system participants?
   * How might changes to their core function or disfunction change outcomes?
   * Think of ways to visualize these ideas literally and abstractly.
4. **Activating approach:** Create primitives as a means to participate in a cause or ideological avenue for engaging in conversation, dialogue, education, or awareness building.
   * What is the function of a primitive in this context?
   * How might primitives be used as a teaching tool, or a tool or designing solutions to problems?
   * Will you be creating objects or images?
   * How will those who view or interact with your work?
5. **Situating approach:** Establish a framework, story, or narrative within which your project ideas live.
   * How might you use a curatorial process to present relationships between objects or ideas?
   * What is the framework that helps structure your ideas?

### Format (Choose one)

Choose a format that you can reasonable accomplish within the timeframe of the project.

1. High resolution: 3000 x 3000 image
2. Poster design (follows a particular poster format)
3. Magazine or book illustration
4. 3D prints with high quality photo documentation and accompanying renders
   * These can be ordered through Penn State Maker Commons or 3D printing service websites such as Sculpteo or Shapeways.
5. Paper-craft object
6. Realtime display on Sketchfab.com
7. Modular game assets

### Production Process (All steps required)

#### Week 1: Concept development

1. Develop concept: Sketch, label, and write ideas in sketchbook.
2. Create Mood board: Find reference images and put them into a large canvas. Save as a single image
3. Create a  

#### Week 2: Production begins

1. Submit screenshots showing significant progress.

#### Week 3: Production continues

1. Write a work statement draft
2. Submit screenshots showing significant progress

#### Week 4: Finish production and present work

1. Upload final materials
2. Submit final work statement
3. Participate in work critique

#### Writing a work statement

A work statement is a clear articulation about what you've made. This is not a journal entry, where you might feel compelled to complain about problems you've had with software, or that it didn't turn out how you wanted. Instead, imagine this is being printed in a magazine, or put on the side of a gallery. What do you want your viewers to come away with?

**Include the following to create a clear work statement:**

* Work title
* What did you literally create?
* Why did you make it?
* What is the work about?
* How is what you did in your work demonstrating what what you've said the work is about?
* Were there any unexpected, interesting, or strange outcomes?
