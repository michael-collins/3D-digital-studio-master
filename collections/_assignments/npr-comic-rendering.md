## Instructions

1. Model a polygonal character in the [T pose](https://www.animatorisland.com/the-t-pose-all-about-the-mighty-blueprint/?v=7516fd43adaa). Choose a ‘sci-fi’ theme or ‘zombie apocalypse’ theme for the character.
2. Follow the tutorials.
3. Create shaders, materials, and freestyle lines to create a manga or comic book visual style.
4. Save a 1920x1080 render as **_LASTNAME_-npr-character_.png_** in the project folder.
5. Save your file as **_LASTNAME_-npr-character.blend** in the project folder.
6. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-npr-character_.zip._**
7. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
8. Double check that you've included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
