 2. Follow the tutorials to add NPR shaders to your creature and the environment.
 3. Create shaders, materials, and freestyle lines to create a manga or comic book visual style.
 4. Choose an interesting composition.
 5. Use the compositing system in Blender to use blending modes and post-effects to enhance the visual quality as seen in the tutorials.
 6. Save a 1920x1080 render as **_LASTNAME_-npr-creature.png** in the project folder.
 7. Save your file as **_LASTNAME_-npr-creature.blend** in the project folder.
 8. Compress the project folder once youâ€™ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-npr-creature.zip.**
 9. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
