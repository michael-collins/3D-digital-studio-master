  title: Description
  content: In this exercise, you will practice unwrapping UVs, exporting a UV map,
    and creating textures in 2D image editing software like Photoshop. You will then
    apply your textures to a polygonal model of the 1927 Kem Weber Airline Chair.

## Instructions

1. Watch tutorials from Blender Foundation on youtube for an introduction to Blender's interface and modeling tools.
2. Create a folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
3. Follow the six-part video demonstration to model the [Kem Weber Airline Chair](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/404536651/images/). Skills to practice include:
   * polygonal edge flow
   * extruding polygon faces
   * inserting edge loops
   * moving, rotating, and scaling vertices, edges, and faces
   * mirroring and duplicating geometry
4. Clean up your [edge flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lip59doQQRk).
5. Save the 3D scene file as '**_LASTNAME_-modeling-chair.blend'** (I.E. – _collins_-modeling-b1.blend) in the project folder.
   * File naming conventions are used to allow your instructor to organize 1,000's of student submitted files, please follow naming conventions.
6. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-modeling-chair.zip.**
7. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
8. Double check that you've included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
