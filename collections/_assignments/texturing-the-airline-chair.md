  title: Description
  content: In this exercise, you will practice unwrapping UVs, exporting a UV map,
    and creating textures in 2D image editing software like Photoshop. You will then
    apply your textures to a polygonal model of the 1927 Kem Weber Airline Chair.

## Instructions

 1. Watch linked tutorials in Learning Resources from Blender Foundation and others to get acquainted with texturing tools.
 2. Duplicate the modeling folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
    * If you were unable to produce a polygonal model, you can download this scene file, and use it to complete the assignment.
 3. Follow the video demonstration to create UV maps to texture the [Kem Weber Airline Chair](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/404536651/images/).
 4. Apply the scale transform to reset each polygonal object.
 5. Unwrap the chair’s parts’ UVs using the various methods and tools described in the tutorials.
 6. Export a UV map for each part and save it in the project folder as **_uv-arm.jpg_**, **_uv-cushion.jpg_**_,_ etc.
 7. Import the UV maps into Photoshop and create textures to match the Airline Chair as closely as possible.
 8. Save the textures as **_arm_color.jpg_**, **_cushion1_color.jpg_**, etc. in the project folder. Name the files in an organized in a logical way.
 9. In Blender, set up the chair’s textures so they are visible on the model.
10. Save the 3D scene file as **_LASTNAME_-texturing-chair** in the project folder.
11. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-texturing-chair.zip.**
12. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
13. Double check that you've included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
