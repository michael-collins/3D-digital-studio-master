3. Find reference images online for your subject and save them to project folder.
4. Use the techniques learned to create a detailed sculpt of an **aquatic sea creature**.
5. Create a second model by retopologizing the sculpt to create a low poly base mesh.
   * You should have two models: Hi-res sculpt and a low poly base mesh model
6. Save your blend file in a project folder **_YOURNAME-sculpting.blend_**.
7. Compress the folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_YOURNAME-sculpting.zip._**
8. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
