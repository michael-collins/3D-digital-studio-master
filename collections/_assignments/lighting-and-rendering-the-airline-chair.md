## Instructions

 1. Watch linked tutorials in Learning Resources from Blender Foundation and others to get acquainted with rendering tools.
 2. Duplicate the texturing folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
 3. Follow the video demonstrations to light and render the [Kem Weber Airline Chair](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/404536651/images/).
 4. Enable **Cycles** rendering mode.
 5. Add a backdrop and three point lighting setup.
 6. Configure your render camera with a pleasing focal length and compose your layout.
 7. Configure the render settings **sampling** to be high enough to reduce noise. Somewhere between 250 and 750 should give good results.
 8. Render and import the image into Photoshop to adjust saturation, contrast.
 9. Save the render as **_LASTNAME_-rendering-chair_.png_**, etc. in the project folder. Name the files in an organized in a logical way.
10. Remove large Photoshop files that you may have in the project folder before compressing for upload.
11. Save the 3D scene file as **_LASTNAME_-rendering-chair** in the project folder.
12. Compress the project folder once youâ€™ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-rendering-chair.zip.**
13. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
14. Double check that you've included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
