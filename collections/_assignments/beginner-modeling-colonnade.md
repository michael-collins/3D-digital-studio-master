  content: In this exercise, you will practice polygonal modeling fundamentals and
    will use 3D software to build a polygonal model of an architectural feature, called
    a colonnade, to create an interior or exterior architectural space.

## Instructions

1. Watch tutorials from Blender Foundation on youtube for an introduction to Blender's interface and modeling tools.
2. Create a folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
3. Follow the video demonstration to model an interior or exterior architectural space. Skills to practice include:
   * polygonal edge flow
   * extruding polygon faces
   * inserting edge loops
   * moving, rotating, and scaling vertices, edges, and faces
   * mirroring and duplicating geometry
4. Clean up your [edge flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lip59doQQRk).
5. Save the 3D scene file as '**_LASTNAME_-modeling-colonnade.blend'** (I.E. – _collins_-modeling-colonnade.blend) in the project folder.
   * File naming conventions are used to allow your instructor to organize 1,000's of student submitted files, please follow naming conventions.
6. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-modeling-colonnade.zip.**
7. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
8. Double check that you've included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
