## Instructions

 1. Watch the tutorials in Learning Resources.
 2. Duplicate the modeling folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
 3. Apply the scale transform to reset each polygonal object.
 4. Unwrap the chair’s parts’ UVs using the various methods and tools described in the tutorials.
 5. Export a UV map for each of the three objects and save it in the project folder as **_uv-object-1.png_**, **_uv-object-2.png_**_, and **uv-object-3.png**_. If you have more than one UV map per object, use a logical naming scheme.
 6. Import the UV maps into Photoshop and create textures.
 7. Save the textures as **object1-color.png**, **object2-color.png**, and **object3-color.png**, etc. in the project folder.
 8. In Blender, set up the chair’s textures so they are visible on the model.
 9. Save the 3D scene file as **_LASTNAME_-texturing-objects** in the project folder.
10. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-texturing-objects.zip.**
11. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
12. Double check that you've included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
