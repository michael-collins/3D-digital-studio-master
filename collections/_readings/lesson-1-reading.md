## Welcome

Welcome to DART 303: 3D Digital Studio. This is a pilot course, which means there are some aspects that are under active development, however, this should not interfere with your ability to progress through the learning materials. To keep the course content fresh and relevant, demos will be recorded shortly before assignments are assigned.

For in-residence University Park campus students, this course is offered synchronously, with bi-weekly zoom meetings. Attendance is mandatory given the nature of University policies. For World Campus students, the content can be completed asynchronously, though you can arrange time with me via office hours.

The kick-off of this course also co-insides with SIGGRAPH 2020's virtual conference this year.
